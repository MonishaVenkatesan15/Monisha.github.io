      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I'm Monisha, a dedicated 3rd-year Computer Application student with expertise in object-oriented programming
        languages such as Python, Java, C++, Perl, and PHP. I am also proficient in front-end languages like HTML and
        CSS, as well as widely used office suites such as Microsoft Office and LibreOffice. With a strong foundation in
        version control systems like Git, I am currently expanding my skills in JavaScript and MySQL.</p>

      <p>Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for programming and problem-solving. I enjoy
        leveraging my knowledge of object-oriented programming to create efficient and scalable solutions. I believe that
        programming is not just about writing code but also about understanding the underlying problem and designing
        elegant and maintainable solutions.</p>

      <p>I am currently seeking opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. I am eager to contribute to
        projects where I can utilize my skills and make a meaningful impact. I have a strong work ethic, excellent
        teamwork abilities, and a commitment to continuous learning.</p>
